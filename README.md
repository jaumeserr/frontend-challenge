# Tech-Frontend-Challenge

# First Step
- You can develop this test challenge with one of this technologies, choose your favorite one:
  - Angular X
  - React

# Goals/Outcomes ✨
- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently
- Link to the source code, use your favorite repository manager (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Link to the deployed Demo, use your favorite static site hosting platform (surge, github-pages, now, ...)
- The app should run on any computer by running npm install , npm test and have a demo online.
- We'll evaluate the exercise by looking commits and test passed.

# Requirements 📖
- Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
 
- Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*

# Think about 💡
- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

# What's Already Been Done 🏁
- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)
- A Spotify request helper (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/)

# Screenshots 🌄
You can choose you favorite design and develop a beautifull UI/UX, we have here one example but you can choose other.
The only thing to keep in mind is that this project should be production ready.
